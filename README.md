- End Goal : Create application where users may add products, related products, commentable product features, product tags, editable entities...
- Motivation : Entry point into .NET development. Also tired of googling "Top 10 {products} for {purpose}".
- Status : Polymorphic database associations for commentable entities. Prototyping available data directly in T-SQL.
